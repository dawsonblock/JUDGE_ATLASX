## Scope and Safety

- Current status: proof-hardened alpha.
- Not ready for production deployment.
- Does not hold legal authority.
- Evidence snapshots are authoritative; memory is derivative.
- AI is reviewer assistance only.
- Source ingestion is disabled by default unless explicitly enabled.
- External folders are reference-only.
- JWT mutation authority is current; legacy shared-token compatibility is deprecated.
- make verify = local no-Docker quality checks.
- make release-proof-local = Docker/PostGIS alpha release gate.
- Current alpha release is blocked if Docker/PostGIS proof fails.
- Docker/PostGIS proof passed in the current release gate.
- Dedicated egress proxy proof passed in the current release gate.
- Dedicated synthetic demo proof passed in the current release gate.
- Proof freshness passed against the stored proof-input file list and tree hash.
- Archive validation passed against the final distributable archive shape.
- archive_validation_log: artifacts/proof/current/archive_validation.log

## Governance Status

- legacy_shared_token_status: deprecated, removal plan documented
- dependency_security_status: npm audit issues triaged for alpha; remediation plan documented

## Egress Proxy Coverage

- Dedicated gate artifact: artifacts/proof/current/egress_proxy_proof.log.
- Production startup proxy policy coverage: backend/app/tests/test_production_fetch_egress_policy.py.
- Runtime proxy opener/wiring coverage: backend/app/tests/test_source_fetcher_proxy.py.
- SSRF defense context coverage remains in backend/app/tests/test_source_fetcher_ssrf.py.
